# Mercury
`v1.0.0`  
The budget planner of the 21st century

:construction: Please be aware that Mercury is in constant development, you may encounter unknown bug :construction:

---

*Mercury* offer basic budget planner functionality, such as managing account, add / edit / delete operation... I always wanted a tool as MSMoney or [HomeBank](http://homebank.free.fr), but with improved and modern UI. HomeBank was the software I used to use, and many features come from there.  
This application is built on top of [Electron](electron.atom.io)


Developped with â™¥ for you
